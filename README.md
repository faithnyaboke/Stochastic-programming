Stochastic programming is an optimization framework that
incorporates uncertainty into decision-making models. Unlike
deterministic optimization, which assumes perfect information about
all parameters, stochastic programming accounts for randomness in
constraints and objectives.

This repository contains a python notebook that is used to predict the optimal
number of ICU beds required for optimal usage at Kenyatta National Hospital. 
Through stochastic programming we are able to know if there is optimal productivity given
the available constraints in the market.
